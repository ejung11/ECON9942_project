            Common-Pool Resource Game

        <p>
            Imagine yourself as a fisherman fishing for fish or local villagers needing to find firewood.
            Fishes and firewood are common-pool resource, anyone can come and harvest as much as they want
            but it can be destroyed when people harvest too much.
