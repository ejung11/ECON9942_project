    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Common-Pool Resources and Partial Output-Sharing</p>
    <p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Professor James C. Cox, Georgia State University</p>
    <p><strong>Co-Investigator:</strong> Eye Eoun (Ian) Jung, Georgia State University</p>
    <p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> AYS Dissertation Fellowship</p>

    <h5>Introduction and Key Information</h5>
    <p>We invite you to take part in a research study. You will decide if you would like to take part in the study. Your participation in the study will last no more than two hours on one day.</p>
    <p>We will ask you to: allocate efforts between two activities. If you do not wish to take part in this study, you can terminate your participation at any time.</p>

    <h5>Purpose</h5>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to understand how individuals make decisions in common-pool resource environments and to assess the impact of partial output-sharing arrangements on resource use.</p>
    <p>You are invited to participate because you have registered on the Experimental Economics Centerâ€™s website as someone interested in participating in experiments.</p>
    <p>We will invite up to 200 people to participate in this study.</p>

    <h5>Procedures</h5>
    <p>If you decide to take part in this study, you will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will allocate efforts between two activities throughout multiple rounds:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Activity A (Fixed Return):</strong> Each effort invested yields a fixed amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Activity B (Variable Return):</strong> Each effort invested yields a return that depends on the total efforts invested by all participants in your group.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your money payoff will be determined by your responses and the responses of anonymous members in your group.</li>
        <li>Interact anonymously with other participants; you will not know their identities, and they will not know yours.</li>
        <li>Fill out a questionnaire.</li>
        <li>You will participate by entering responses on a computer in the lab of the Experimental Economics Center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Future Research</h5>
    <p>We will not retain any information that could personally identify you. We may use your anonymous responses in the experiment for future research. We will not ask for consent from you if we do this.</p>

    <h5>Risks</h5>
    <p>You will not have any more risks than you would in a normal day of life.</p>

    <h5>Benefits</h5>
    <p>This study is not designed to benefit you personally. We hope to gain information about how individuals make decisions in common-pool resource environments and to assess the impact of partial output-sharing arrangements on resource use.</p>

    <h5>Alternatives</h5>
    <p>The alternative to taking part in this study is to not take part in the study.</p>

    <h5>Compensation</h5>
    <p>If you decide to participate, you will receive compensation in U.S. dollars at the end of the experiment session. The amount of compensation will be determined by your decisions and the decisions of anonymous members in your group.</p>

    <h5>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</h5>
    <p>You do not have to be in this study. If you decide to be in the study and change your mind, you can drop out at any time.</p>
