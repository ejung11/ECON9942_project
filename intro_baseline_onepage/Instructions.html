    <div class="instructions-subheading">Random Matching and Anonymity</div>
    <p>
        In this experiment, you will be <strong>randomly assigned to a group of 8 people</strong>.
        The group you are assigned to will <strong>stay the same throughout the entire experiment</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="instructions-subheading">Settings</div>
    <p>
        You will be playing an <strong>effort allocation game</strong> in a <strong>group of 8 people</strong>.
        In each round, you will decide how to allocate efforts between two different activities.
        Each round, you are endowed with <strong>25 efforts</strong> and must decide how many to allocate
        to <strong>Activity A</strong> and <strong>Activity B</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Activity A</strong>: For each effort allocated to Activity A, you will receive a <strong>fixed return of 5 ECUs</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Activity B</strong>: The return on efforts allocated to Activity B is <strong>variable</strong>
            and depends on the <strong>total efforts allocated by the entire group, including yours</strong>.

            <br> <br>
            The return for each effort allocated to Activity B is:
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>20 - 0.1171 × (group's total effort allocated to Activity B) ECUs per effort</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Note that the return from Activity B <b><span class="ecu">decreases</span></b>
        as the total efforts allocated to Activity B by the group <b><span class="ecu">increases</span></b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your earnings for each round will depend on both <strong>your own decisions</strong>
        and the decisions of <strong>others in your group</strong>.
    </p>


    <div class="instructions-subheading">Multiple Rounds</div>
    <p>The game consists of <strong>10 decision rounds</strong>.
        In each round, you will face the same decision task, where you will allocate efforts between Activity A and Activity B.</p>


    <div class="instructions-subheading">Earnings</div>
    <p>After everyone has submitted their decisions, the earnings for the round will be calculated and shown to you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Earnings from Activity A</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Earnings from Activity B</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your final earnings will be the sum of your earnings across all 10 rounds.</p>

        <p>
            This is round 1 of the game. <br>
            Assume the group's total allocation to Activity B is <strong>60 efforts</strong>.
            <br> <br>
            The return for each effort allocated to Activity B will be:
            <br>
             <strong>20 - 0.1171 × 60 = 12.97 ECUs per effort</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you allocate <strong>10 efforts</strong> to Activity B, your earnings from Activity B will be:
            <br>
            <strong>10 × 12.97 = 129.7 ≈ 130 ECUs</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            For your remaining <strong>15 efforts</strong> allocated to Activity A, your earnings from Activity A will be:
            <br>
            <strong>15 × 5 = 75 ECUs</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, your total earnings for this round will be:
            <br>
            <strong>130 + 75 = 205 ECUs</strong>
        </p>

            This is round 5 of the game.
            <br>
            Assume the group's total allocation to Activity B is <strong>120 efforts</strong>.
            <br> <br>
            The return for each effort allocated to Activity B will be:
            <br>
            <strong>20 - 0.1171 × 120 = 5.95 ECUs per effort</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you allocate <strong>10 efforts</strong> to Activity B, your earnings from Activity B will be:
            <br>
            <strong>10 × 5.95 = 59.5 ≈ 60 ECUs</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            For your remaining <strong>15 efforts</strong> allocated to Activity A, your earnings from Activity A will be:
            <br>
            <strong>15 × 5 = 75 ECUs</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, your total earnings for this round will be:
            <br>
            <strong>60 + 75 = 135 ECUs</strong>
