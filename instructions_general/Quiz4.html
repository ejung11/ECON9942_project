    You are being tasked with making an investment decision with 1000 research points.
    At the end of the experiment, all of your research points (not just your profit) will be
    converted into real dollars and your payout will be determined by your earnings throughout the
    experiment. The exchange rate between research points and real dollars is 0.005.
    In other words, 1000 research points will translate into $5.
