        <h4><strong>Decision & Earnings</strong></h4>
         <p>
             In this game, there are upto 20 rounds. But game could end early. The rules about the rounds will be specified in the next page.
         </p>

        <p>
            In every round, you will be given <strong>25 efforts</strong> and
            you will be submitting <strong>how many efforts to harvest</strong>  that represents how much you are going to harvest in each season.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will receive tokens from harvesting the resource depends on how much you invested your effort and others' effort.
            Consider each token represents the monetary benefit of, for example, one ton of fish. <br>
            Your return on harvesting is decided by group's total harvest. The return for each effort harvesting is
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>23 - 0.25*(group's total harvest)</strong>  tokens.
        </p>
            Consider this as more people harvest fishes, it will be harder to find fish, thus the cost of harvesting increases as the number of total harvest increases.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will also receive tokens from not harvesting depends only on your remaining efforts.
            Consider this as monetary benefit from the work other than the harvesting. <br>
            You will earn <strong>5 tokens for each of remaining efforts</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, if the <strong>group's total harvest is 40, and you decided to harvest 10</strong>. <br>
            The return on harvest will be <strong>23-0.25*40 = 13</strong>  for each harvest.
            Your earnings from harvest is <strong>130 tokens</strong> . <br>
            For your remaining efforts of 15, you will earn 5 tokens for each, which is <strong>75 tokens</strong> . <br>
            Thus your earned tokens this round will be <strong>205 tokens</strong> .
        </p>

        <p>
            After everyone submitted, the earnings of the round will be calculated and showed to you.
