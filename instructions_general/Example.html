        <h4><strong>Examples: situation 1</strong></h4>

        <p>
            This is round 1 of the game. <br>
            Let's assume that in this round, group's total harvest was <strong>40</strong>. <br>
            Thus, the return from harvesting the resource is 23 - 0.25 * 40 = <strong> 13</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you decided to put <strong>10 efforts</strong> to harvest. <br>
            You will be earning <strong>10 * 13 = 130 from harvest</strong> , <strong>5 * 15 = 150 from other work</strong>. <br>
            Thus, Your earnings in this round is <strong>280 tokens</strong>. <br>
            And since the total harvest is <strong>less than 100</strong>, your group will continue to next round and have chance to earn more. <br>
            Probability of ending is <strong>0%</strong>.

        <h4><strong>Examples: situation 2</strong></h4>

        <p>
            This is round 5 of the game.  <br>
            Let's assume that in this round, group's total harvest was <strong>120</strong>. <br>
            Thus, the return from harvesting the resource is 23 - 0.25 * 120 = <strong>-7</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you decided to put <strong>10 efforts</strong> to harvest. <br>
            You will be earning <strong>10 * (-7) = - 70 from harvest</strong>, <strong>5 * 15 = 150 from other work</strong>. <br>
            Thus, Your earnings in this round is <strong>80 tokens</strong>. <br>
            And since the total harvest is <strong>more than 100</strong> , the game could end at this round. <br>
            Probability of ending is 120 / 2 = <strong>60%</strong>
